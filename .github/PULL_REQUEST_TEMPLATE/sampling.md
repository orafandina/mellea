# Sampling Strategy PR

Use this template when adding or modifying sampling strategies in `mellea/stdlib/sampling/`.

## Description
- [ ] Link to Issue: 

<!-- Brief description of the sampling strategy being added/modified along with an explanation for why it should be in the standard library. -->

## Implementation Checklist

### Base Class
- [ ] Extends appropriate base class:
  - `BaseSamplingStrategy` if your changes are mostly modifying the `repair` and/or `select_from_failure` functions
  - `SamplingStrategy` if your changes involve a new `sample` method
  - Other defined sampling strategies if your implementation is similar to existing implementations

### Return Value
- [ ] Returns a properly typed `SamplingResult`. Specifically, this means:
  - `ModelOutputThunk`s in `sample_generations` are properly typed from the Component and the `parsed_repr` is the expected type.

### Integration
- [ ] Strategy exported in `mellea/stdlib/sampling/__init__.py`

### Testing
- [ ] Tests added to `tests/sampling/`
- [ ] New code has 100% coverage
- [ ] Ensure existing tests and github automation passes (a maintainer will kick off the github automation when the rest of the PR is populated)
